<br><h3>Python applications:</h3>
<p>"run_KENO.py": Main application for checking highest occuring numbers, making predictions by call, making predictions by automatic mode, etc.... All around application.
<br><br>"quick_KENO.py": quickly generates top profit original type predictions for 6,7 and 12 spot games.
<br><br>"pred_testing.py": application that takes in all predictions and spits out a complete means dataset and 3 datasets corresponding to the prediction types with all profitable combinations.


<br><h3>Prediction Types</h3>
<h6>All prediction types are in some way based on a theory/idea of long term occurance vs. short term luck.</h6>
<p>"O": Original prediction types. Based on occurances in general. Regardless to when they fell.
<br><br>"X": Positional prediction types. Based on when the occurances occurred. Splits the 20 drawn numbers into bins based on how many numbers you choose. Then predicts based on occurances in those bins.
<br><br>"Z": Mixed-type Predictions are 4 variations that involve combinations of the other 2 prediction types.</p>
